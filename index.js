/*
	Greetings, and welcome to the server-side source code for Spark-Coins!  This program runs on Node.JS (currently version 16) and manages HTTP(S) requests, WebSocket Connections, and Google's Spreadsheet API as the back-end to the Spark-Coin idea.  See ./views/index.ejs for the client-side HTML document and script.
	I'm hoping to leverage Transparency as Security, so if you see a flaw or bug in this program, feel free to update it or poke me (Brian Westgate)!  I'm just a hobbyist programmer working on this as a side-project, so I'm sure there are plenty of bugs and/or better ways to do things.
